The report can be found in the docs folder ==> 4020_lab2_report.pdf

The implementations can be run by running the bash script in the root folder ==> ./compile_and_run.sh

The results are printed out to the console but are also saved to csv files.

The format for these CSV is as follows:

matrix_size,naive_time_taken,diagonal_time_taken,block_time_taken

For the pthreads implementation, naive_time_taken is omitted.
